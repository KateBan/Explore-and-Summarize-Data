Wine Quality Exploration
========================================================
# Introduction

This project investigates the relationship between the ranking of red and white wines quality by human experts and 11 variables resulting from physicochemical tests carried out against the wines.

The issue of quality has become increasingly important to the wine industry over the past several decades. Worldwide, an oversupply situation has prevailed, consequently pulling down wine prices and decreasing profitable margins for producers. It has been suggested that the wine industry must vigilantly attend to wine quality, in conjunction to marketing efforts in order to lead the competition. This raises important question as to what is meant by quality regarding wine.
Quality may be understood in different ways. Generally, quality in foods and beverages is defined as the ability of a set of inherent characteristics of a product, system or process to fulfill requirements of customers and other interested parties. From the perspective of marketing, with reference to wine, there exist two quality dimensions based on the consumer experiences: the external (grapes, production and marketing) and the internal (pleasure, appearance, gustatory, paradigmatic and potential) quality, the latter being more significant in evaluating the overall wine quality during consumption. However, some marketing studies have defined the concept of quality as a one-dimensional judgment.Perceived quality is a broad overview and exists on a continuum.
